    <h1 class="title">About vglist</h1>

    <p>vglist helps you track your entire video game library across every store and platform.</p>
    <p>Most of the data in the database comes from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, a sister project of Wikipedia. Thanks to them for hosting so much freely-licensed data!</p>
    <p>The site is still in a Beta state, so there are still plenty of rough edges. Thank you for bearing with them while I work to build out more of the site! You can follow development by reading the <a href="https://github.com/connorshea/vglist/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">Changelog</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have feature requests, I'm happy to recieve them (though I can't promise I'll implement them). For now, the best place to request features or to report bugs is <a href="https://github.com/connorshea/vglist/issues">in the GitHub issue tracker</a> or in the #feedback channel on the Discord server (linked in the navbar dropdown). The site is available as an open source project <a href="https://github.com/connorshea/vglist">on GitHub</a>, and anyone that wants to contribute to the project is welcome. It's built with <a href="https://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
